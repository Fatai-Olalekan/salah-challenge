 <h1>Cooking with Daniel from Nada Surf</h1>
 <p>I had the pleasure of spending a crisp, Spring day in portsmouth, NH cooking and chatting with Daniel Lorca of the band Nada Surf as he prepared a gourment, sit-down dinner for 28 pals</p>   
 <p>when I first invited Nada Surf to be on the show, I was told that Daniel Lorca was the guy I wanted to talk to. Then Daniel emailed his response:"i'm way into it, but i wanna do it".After years of only having access to  </p>
 <h2>Six-hour Salad</h2>
 <p><img src="../salads.jpg"></p>
 <p>Daniel prepared a salad of aruguls, smoked tomatoes, tomatoes jam, and grilled avocado(it's as good as it sounds!). I jokingly called it "6-hour salad" because that's how long he worked on it. The fresh tomatoes were slowly smoked over woodchips in the grill, and when they were softened, Daniel separated out the seds which he reduced into a smoky jam. The tomatoes wre cut stripsto put on the salads. As in day meandered, the avocados finaaly went on the grill after dark. I was on flashlight duty while Daniel checked for the perfect grill marks </p>
 <p>I wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that requires <em>much</em> less time and serves 6 people instead of <i>five</i>times that amount </p>
 <h2>The Main Course</h2>
 <p>In addition to the smoky grilled salad. Daniel served tarragon cornish hens with a cognac cream sauce loaded with chanterelled and grapes, and wild rice with grilled ramps(wild garlicky leeks).Daniel was served close to midnight, but it was a party so nobody cared </p>
 <p>We left that might (technically early the next morning )with full bellies, new cooking tips, and nearly 5 hours of footage. I'm considering renaming the show "Cooking with Nada Surf" </p>
